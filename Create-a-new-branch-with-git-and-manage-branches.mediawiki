In your github fork, you need to keep your master branch clean, i mean by clean without any changes, like that you can create at any time a branch from your master. Each time, that you want commit a bug or
a feature, you need to create a branch for it, which will be somehow the copy of your master branch. 

When you will do a pull request on a branch, you can continue to work on an another branch and make an another pull request on this other branch. 

Before create a new branch pull the changes from upstream, your master need to be uptodate.

Create the branch on your local machine :

<pre>git branch <name_of_your_new_branch></pre>

Push the branch on github :

<pre>git push origin <name_of_your_new_branch></pre>

Swtich to your new branch :

<pre>git checkout <name_of_your_new_branch></pre>

When you want commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.

You can see all branches created by using 

<pre>git branch </pre>

Which will show :

<pre>
* approval_messages
  master
  master_clean
</pre>

Add a new remote for you branch :

<pre>git remote add <name_of_your_remote> <url></pre>

Push changes from your commit into your branch :

<pre>git push origin <name_of_your_remote></pre>

Delete a branch on your local filesytem :

<pre>git branch -d <name_of_your_new_branch></pre>

Delete the branch on github :

<pre>git push origin :<name_of_your_new_branch></pre>

The only difference it's the : to say delete.

If you want to change default branch, it's so easy with github, in your fork go into Admin and in the drop-down list default branch choose what you want.
